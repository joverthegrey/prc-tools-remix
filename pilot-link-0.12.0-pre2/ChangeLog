2005-01-25 09:01  fpillet

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: updated to properly detect PQA files. Previous

2005-01-25 08:42  fpillet

	* include/pi-dlp.h: added new DB flag definitions up to (and

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: Don't use asprintf since it isn't available

	* src/read-notepad.c: Default to png.  If you don't have libpng and
	  don't specify that you want ppm, you'll get a warning about
	  getting ppm instead of png.  I figure that is reasonable, pending
	  a rewrite of this program which supports installing new notepad
	  pages.

	  Aaron's patch this time

2005-01-10 07:50  fpillet

	* libpisock/: socket.c: Aaron's fix: reset pi_buffer_t in
	  protocol_queue_build() after reading a first byte when protocol

2005-01-10 06:03  fpillet

	* libpisock/dlp.c: log error and dump invalid data in

2005-01-09 06:42  knghtbrd

	* include/pi-contact.h, libpisock/contact.c,
	  tests/contactsdb-test.c: Turned ContactsAppInfo_t labels field
	  into an opaque pi_buffer_t.  Fixed a typeo in the name of
	  free_ContactsAppInfo, and modified contactsdb_test accordingly.

2005-01-09 06:06  knghtbrd

	* include/pi-contact.h, libpisock/contact.c,
	  tests/contactsdb-test.c: structs ContactsAppInfo and Contact have
	  _t typedefs now.  Added numCustoms field to ContactsAppInfo and
	  removed the addr/im/phone labels (how they're done will change
	  soon).  Packing a ContactsAppInfo now copies the customLabels
	  field back in to the labels array before writing (you should
	  treat labels and internal as opaque!)  Added freeContactsAppInfo
	  for disposing of allocated data in the structure.  Added more
	  error checking where it was needed.  Fixed up Copyright headers
	  and included proper attributions.  Moved function documentation
	  from contact.c to pi-contact.h, where it will do more good.

2005-01-06 02:12  knghtbrd

	* src/pilot-foto.c: Check your pointers before you dereference
	  them!

2005-01-05 15:09  adridg

	* src/install-todo.c: Avoid printing possible uninitialized buffer.

2005-01-02 19:44  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Make --delete-all work

2005-01-02 06:15  knghtbrd

	* include/pi-contact.h, libpisock/contact.c,
	  tests/contactsdb-test.c: Tweaked the handling of the picture
	  field of a Contact.  We have enough information now to process
	  and recreate the header, so we now do so in the pack/unpack
	  functions.  The picture field will contain only the JPEG data
	  now, and the pictype field has been added to help future-proof
	  the structure.  Currently accepted values for pictype are
	  cpic_none and cpic_jpeg.  I also cleaned up some function
	  headers.

2004-12-31 01:58  knghtbrd

	* include/pi-contact.h, libpisock/contact.c,
	  tests/contactsdb-test.c: The next stage of my libpisock Contacts
	  code rewrite.  All functions now take pi_buffer_t's instead of
	  seperate buffers/lens and return 0 or -1 on error.  The only
	  function not completely rewritten from the ContactsDB code
	  contributed by ... who contributed it? ... is pack_Contact, which
	  is going to remain as-is until I add AddressDB handling to this
	  code.

	  Please note, while I was able to promise byte-for-byte AppInfo,
	  there are a couple of unused nybbles whose (unused) contents are
	  not reproduced.

2004-12-23 12:28  knghtbrd

	* tests/contactsdb-test.c: contactsdb-test now uses the libpisock
	  code because I needed to be sure that the libpisock code actually
	  worked on all devices I could test.

2004-12-23 12:24  knghtbrd

	* include/pi-contact.h, libpisock/contact.c: Support for all
	  versions of ContactsDB, plus some minor bugfixes for the existing
	  support for Tungsten E/T3.  I can't myself use this format, so
	  expect it to change between now and 0.12's final release to be
	  more similar to the format I cooked up for my own use.

	* src/Makefile.am: More cruft-removal

2004-12-22 19:27  desrod

	* autogen.sh: Remove some unused cruft (actually, this is a
	  stealthy attempt to test the commit log emails, shh!)

2004-12-22 19:22  desrod

	* autogen.sh: This should really be refactored a bit, it isn't
	  self-healing or scalable, but for the short term, this will do.

2004-12-22 17:57  adridg

	* src/: Makefile.am, addresses.c, pilot-archive.c: Remove

	* src/: pilot-addresses.c, pilot-archive.c, pilot-treofoto.c,
	  read-expenses.c, reminders.c, userland.c: Remove remainder of
	  wonky no-args handling

2004-12-21 16:58  adridg

	* include/pi-userland.h, src/addresses.c, src/dlpsh.c: dlpsh needs

	* src/pi-nredir.c: Back out previous 'fix': you _must_ specify -n
	  now to get pi-nredir to function. Calling it with no args will
	  print usage.

2004-12-21 15:03  adridg

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: pilot-xfer needs an argument to indicate
	  action, so let it bail with no args just like everyone else

	  src/pilot-archive.c, src/pilot-treofoto.c, src/read-expenses.c,
	  src/reminders.c, src/userland.c: Another thing slapped into
	  userland.

	  For the conduits that don't _need_ any arguments, if there is a
	  port set somewhere else (for the time being: in PILOTPORT), don't
	  bail out but do your stuff.

2004-12-20 17:27  adridg

	* configure.ac, libpisock/Makefile.am, libpisock++/Makefile.am: Fix

	  recompile with -fPIC

2004-12-20 17:15  desrod

	* include/: pi-datebook.hxx, pi-serial.h, pi-source.h: Remove the

	* libpisock/: connect.c, pi-header.c: Marked as deprecated, warn
	  the user about is as well.

2004-12-20 15:52  adridg

	* include/pi-header.h: Remove prototypes for functions never
	  created, and mark the remainder deprecated. These prototypes
	  cover functions in connect.c and pi-header.c

2004-12-20 15:50  adridg

	* include/pi-util.h: Add a means to mark functions as deprecated

2004-12-20 15:49  adridg

	* include/pi-version.h.in: Add a PILOT_LINK_IS macro for doing
	  conditional compilation based on version number (used extensively
	  in KPilot, for one thing, which keeps compatibility with 0.11 and
	  0.12)

2004-12-20 14:36  desrod

	* libpisock/: Makefile.am, winserial.c: Removed references to

2004-12-20 14:35  desrod

	* libpisock/: inet.c, serial.c, slp.c, socket.c, syspkt.c, utils.c:
	  Remove any references to legacy WIN32 serial support and NeXT
	  support. When or if someone helps us port this back to Windows,
	  with serial and USB support, these can return, but will need to
	  be rewritten from the ground-up anyway.

2004-12-20 05:34  fpillet

	* libpisock/net.c: added useful comment so we don't lose track of
	  why these values are here

2004-12-19 06:51  knghtbrd

	* tests/contactsdb-test.c: Satisfy any legal weenies who might
	  protest my "license", and make it damned clear that you don't get
	  stuff I didn't write under it.

2004-12-18 20:04  adridg

	* src/pilot-archive.c: Nothing to CSV here, folks. Move along.

2004-12-18 19:58  adridg

	* src/pilot-clip.c: Fix up option descriptions.

2004-12-17 16:40  adridg

2004-12-17 15:05  desrod

	* Makefile.am: Bump automake version check down by one

2004-12-17 12:18  fpillet

	* libpisock/pi-file.c: fixed dlp_ReadAppBlock call

2004-12-17 09:10  fpillet

	* include/pi-serial.h, libpisock/serial.c, libpisock/unixserial.c:
	  Converted the printfs to LOG messages. Fixed issues in
	  initalizing the protocol structs. Removed buggy ref ptr which was
	  being improperly read in unixserial and would cause some code to
	  be sporadically executed

2004-12-17 09:04  knghtbrd

	* libpisock/: inet.c, net.c: Okay, new palmOne devices use a USB
	  chip that is broken.	Florent already applied a workaround to the
	  code, but it had to be enabled.  However, there is no good way to
	  know when to do this.  So we will always enable it, except when
	  we know we don't need it.  Performance cost?	A few (less than
	  ten) miliseconds per megabyte.  You won't notice.  Really, you
	  won't.

2004-12-17 08:59  knghtbrd

	* tests/contactsdb-test.c: Erm, how did this get not inited
	  properly?

2004-12-17 06:36  adridg

	* libpisock/pi-header.c: Use right option explanation; why the heck
	  is this in the library _anyway_

2004-12-16 01:04  warp

	* include/pi-dlp.hxx: Let the c++ headers compile again, someone
	  missed something.

2004-12-15 11:24  fpillet

	* src/: pilot-addresses.c, pilot-archive.c, read-expenses.c,
	  read-ical.c, read-notepad.c, read-screenshot.c, read-todos.c,

	* src/: addresses.c, hinotes.c, install-expenses.c,
	  install-hinote.c, install-memo.c, memos.c, money2qif.c: updating
	  code for new prototype of dlp_ReadAppBlock

2004-12-15 11:03  fpillet

	* tests/: contactsdb-test.c, dlp-test.c: Ãupdated use of

2004-12-15 10:55  fpillet

	* include/pi-dlp.h, libpisock/dlp.c: moved dlp_ReadAppBlock and
	  dlp_ReadSortBlock to return data in pi_buffer_t*. Added some more
	  logging to dlp_ReadDBList. Reordered code managing date
	  conversion

	  /dev/null in here.  Oh well.

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/getopt.c, src/getopt.h,
	  src/getopt1.c, src/pilot-mail.c: Added (currently unused)
	  NULL_DEVICE define to pilot-link, should be set to a string
	  containing whatever your system calls /dev/null.  Currently
	  always /dev/null because I don't know the host strings for win32
	  and OS/2 off the top of my head--but this is okay because support
	  for those platforms needs a rewrite anyway.

	  Also consigned getopt and the long-deprecated pilot-mail to the
	  attic.

2004-12-13 02:40  knghtbrd

	* tests/contactsdb-test.c: Okay, now contactsdb-test is done.
	  Prints out the data in a useful format that's easy enough to
	  read, and includes actually names the fields properly.

2004-12-13 01:15  knghtbrd

	* tests/contactsdb-test.c: Now fully dumps ContactsDB-PAdd data for
	  all versions of the file.  For the sake of sanity, doesn't
	  hexprint photos, just their size.

2004-12-12 18:14  adridg

	* doc/man/pilot-addresses.1.in: Match current code

2004-12-12 18:02  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Avoid handing category -1 to
	  dlp_DeleteCategory

2004-12-12 17:48  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Do progress reporting, and suppress
	  totally empty entries (which crop up if you read in a DOS-style
	  CRLF file)

2004-12-12 17:30  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: pilot-addresses is now compatible with
	  itself again. yay. read _and_ write 21-field entries now, handle
	  showphone referencing properly. if you use un-augmented entries,
	  all you lose is the showphone property. this is _not_ compatible
	  with PD-output, i think, since PD puts the phoneLabel in brackets
	  after the entry.

2004-12-12 16:03  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Remove -T; #-comment lines are standard,
	  so just generate them unequivocally.

2004-12-12 15:55  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Make encodechars default and mandatory,
	  since we generate _really_ broken CSV otherwise.

2004-12-12 10:50  desrod

	* autogen.sh, configure.in: Deprecate configure.in in favor of the
	  preferred (and recommended) configure.ac file format

2004-12-12 10:47  desrod

	* configure.ac: Stay in lockstep with configure.in's most-recent
	  change, oops!

2004-12-12 10:45  desrod

	* configure.ac: Will deprecate configure.in when this has been
	  tested fully

2004-12-12 10:41  desrod

	* Makefile.am: Bump minimum required version of automake, because
	  of the added autoconf strict checking

2004-12-11 14:14  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Some code docs; numbers -> enum constants;
	  improve an error message.

2004-12-11 09:27  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Buffer overflow protection, from one of
	  the bugreports closed last night

2004-12-11 05:47  fpillet

	* include/pi-dlp.h, libpisock/dlp.c: turn id_ into recuid, makes
	  things more explicit (I already had this mod in my local tree)

2004-12-10 19:25  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Fix for 1085; --delete-all wasn't working.

2004-12-10 19:14  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Simplify, simplify, and fix #28, #1073,
	  #717, and lots of others in one go.

2004-12-10 18:18  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Skip comments properly (#830, #1093). Set
	  the fields in the address structure so that you can actually
	  install an address entry from CSV. Remove spurious while() that
	  was probably left over from when this was a do-loop.

2004-12-10 15:46  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Deal with bug #830: every other line is
	  skipped. This looks like a half-finished bugfix on CSV reading --
	  the fgets() reads a line and it is neatly split into fields, but
	  the _rest_ of the code is still using getc() to read characters
	  directly from the file.  Dumped the fgets stuff, so that it at
	  least reads all the lines in the file (doesn't do anything useful
	  with them, though, see all the other address bugs).

2004-12-10 15:35  adridg

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Provide more useful --help and --usage

2004-12-10 08:34  adridg

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: Don't use OpenConduit during a transfer

2004-12-10 04:34  knghtbrd

	* tests/contactsdb-test.c: One of my random trees had an
	  uncommitted contactsdb-test with the AppInfo decoding finished.
	  Keep in mind, this is brute force and does not use the functions
	  in libpisock to decode ContactsDB, but it also works on every
	  "modern" palmOne device I have, including the Tungsten T5.
	  That'd be more impressive if it actually did something
	  useful--anyone know how we can tell what country numbers are?  23
	  (0x17) is apparently the United States.

	  errors with this in their own code (*pilot) around the id -> id_

2004-12-09 18:47  adridg

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: * Rename pilot_cardinfo palm_cardinfo, matching
	  all the other functions   in pilot-xfer.  * Send some error
	  messages to stderr.  * -f does VFS, too so mention it in the help
	  string.

2004-12-09 14:36  knghtbrd

	* include/pi-contact.h: At least provide a warning to people
	  reading the header that they can't trust the functions contained
	  therein to work on later devices.  No sense in failing to
	  document what we know.

2004-12-05 12:33  knghtbrd

	  Refer to them in a few manpages 3) Add a manpage for getromtoken
	  (1) 4) Mention the new --sysinfo flavor of getrom (1)

	  TODO) Merge all the pi-get* manpages, since it's one executable

2004-12-03 16:38  adridg

	* doc/man/pi-getram.1.in: Use the correct appname.

	  Two issues come to mind with the manpages: 1) Since all of
	  userland takes --help, --usage, --port, --quiet,    perhaps those
	  command-line args should be in pilot-link (7)    to save space in
	  the rest.  2) Do we really want the manpages to be (C) FSF?

2004-12-03 13:54  knghtbrd

2004-12-02 17:28  adridg

	* src/pi-getrom.c: Minuscule feature: printing SysInfo. The

2004-12-01 10:37  adridg

2004-12-01 10:26  fpillet

	* include/pi-net.h, include/pi-socket.h, libpisock/net.c: added two
	  new sockopt options for NET sockets to allow spliting writes (NET
	  header + data) and also split data in chunks when appropriate
	  (i.e. for USB writes on some devices)

2004-12-01 10:23  fpillet

	* include/pi-args.h: added shielding against multiple inclusions

2004-12-01 05:30  fpillet

	* libpisock/net.c: tentative fix for USB issues: as seen on the
	  Windows USB log, write NET header first (6 bytes) then DLP packet
	  split into 4k chunks. This will hopefully fix the Zire 72 and T5
	  issues. If this work, we can afford using this technique on USB
	  and when connected through other means (inet, bluetooth) then
	  perform single-writes to speedup data transfers.

2004-11-28 15:03  knghtbrd

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: pilot-xfer -D / -l will now list the root of
	  the default VFS volume, if there is a default.  (Adriaan's logic
	  is that there is a default when there is exactly one VFS
	  volume--I intend to change that, but haven't yet.)  This means
	  that -l can no longer provide VFS card info.	Which is fine,
	  because you can now use pilot-xfer -C for that purpose.

2004-11-24 05:47  fpillet

	* libpisock/dlp.c: Take two on previous patch. I think that in the
	  long run, we may need to drop this request != result command
	  check since DLP is processing only one request at a time, and
	  palm software engineers seem to often fail to return proper codes
	  (probably a code cut-and-paste side effect)

	* libpisock/dlp.c: Tungsten T5 returns wrong command
	  (dlpFuncEndOfSync) for dlpFuncWriteResource

2004-11-23 06:00  fpillet

	* libpisock/dlp.c: Added LOG in dlp_exec to track down cases where
	  the result command code is not the same than the request's (may
	  give us a lead to T5 issues). Fixed error code returned by
	  dlp_WriteAppPreference

2004-11-21 16:55  adridg

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: Make fetch progress reporting obey --quiet;
	  note that without progress reporting, cancels are not detected --
	  this is something to fix in the library functions.

	  Split the VFS fetch into a function suitable for a library and a
	  userland part (just like with install). Do progress reporting
	  with it as well.

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: Possible progress reporting for --fetch; I
	  don't think pi_file_retrieve calls the progress function, though.

2004-11-21 15:35  adridg

	* src/install-user.c: Cleanup usage message; basically, the first
	  bit of the string set in OtherOptionHelp immediately follows the
	  usage output that summarizes the options -- it should not contain
	  any of the flags or options, but at most contain a name for the
	  'remaining arguments' like "FILES ...".  Nearly all conduits use
	  \n\n here, since there's no sensible remaining arguments.

	  Make the conduit obey --quiet.

	  Add a --list to avoid the usage-if-no-args scenario for folks
	  with PILOT_PORT set.

	  Follow coding conventions, I think. Fix vi modeline.

	  Add obsequious message to sync log on Palm also when just listing
	  user.

2004-11-21 13:09  desrod

	* src/install-user.c: Rolled back to the previous example output of
	  this conduit. There be bugs here with the --help and --usage

2004-11-20 20:10  adridg

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: Obey --quiet to suppress progress reporting
	  (maybe also want to suppress more); handle cancels by stopping
	  install (tested with internal memory only).

2004-11-20 19:35  adridg

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: Progress reporting when installing to internal
	  or VFS memory, uses pi_file_install's progress function with a
	  bit of a hack around pi_file_open (which doesn't set the
	  filename). Code shuffled about so that there is a
	  pi_file_install_VFS which might be ripe for inclusion in
	  libpisock.

	  doing things in pi_bind that should be done in pi_listen.  It is
	  true that he is, but then he's not the only one.  All it takes to
	  make the message get printed, though, is to fflush stdout.  While

	* src/: install-expenses.c, read-expenses.c: Use the global string
	  tables from pi-expense.c in libpisock. Do some more argument
	  checking -- hopefully this is correct, to avoid NULL amount
	  strings, for instance. I don't have a copy of Expenses to test
	  with.

2004-11-13 18:28  adridg

	* src/install-expenses.c: Userlandify. Removed short option for
	  replace, since it does delete data. install-expenses now installs
	  _an_ expense record even if you give it --replace or --category,
	  which it didn't do recently.

	  Still needs some better argument checking and indent.

	  pilot-foto.c, pilot-schlep.c, pilot-wav.c, read-expenses.c,
	  read-todos.c: Removed all mention to /dev/pilot in src!
	  serial:/dev/ttyUSB0 is used instead, just because it's probably a
	  little more obvious that you shouldn't be making random symlinks
	  as newbies keep trying to do for /dev/pilot.

	  Of course, it means that as soon as the device specs are finished
	  being hashed out as part of my planned attack on socket code,
	  someone will have to write some docs to explain it so people
	  don't ask silly questions like why you would use serial: to talk
	  to a Palm with a USB cradle with Linux and visor.ko.	I'll worry

	* libpisock/connect.c, src/plu_args.c: Just a couple of comment
	  cleanups.  Note pilot_connect() is deprecated, since it really
	  doesn't belong in libpisock.	We should not remove it now because
	  the underlying API may change (that would annoy people) and
	  because we have no good incentive for getting rid of it yet.

	  /dev/pilot, I see DEATH.

	  Regarding the error message, checking for a null port on a bad
	  result is a bandaid.	Since I realised pilot_connect would
	  eventually go away, I kinda painted myself into a corner with my
	  changes to pi_bind.  plu_connect is basically a copy of
	  pilot_connect with the same flaw, so it gets the same bandaid.  I
	  need to revisit this problem later, but there's some socket level
	  stuff that needs to happen first so that we can actually report
	  useful error messages.

	* src/: hinotes.c, install-hinote.c: Userlandification of both;

	* src/: memos.c, userland.c: Still needs a bit of cleanup here, but
	  we have to make sure we're spitting out USEFUL messages when the

	  The other problem here (not fixed in this commit) is that we're

2004-11-01 19:32  adridg

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: After much discussion, back and forth, modify
	  pilot-xfer's argument handling _again_; it now does:

	  * Sanity checking before connecting.	* Accepts exactly _one_ of
	  the -bursimfdlL flags and complains	otherwise.  * -burs still
	  take a <dir>.  * -imfd don't take a particular argument, but
	  apply to all the   leftovers. This covers cases like

	    --install foo.prc --port /dev/pilot
	    --install *.prc --port /dev/pilot
	    --install --port /dev/pilot --vfsdir /slot1/ *.prc

	    You can't mix them, though -- this was deemed too compilcated
	  and
	    unused anyway, so no --install *.prc --delete *.mp3.
	  * -lL don't take any extra arguments, and will complain if they
	  are found.  * --Purge, if present, is done after -bursimfdlL.

	  I do not claim to have tested all combinations of arguments that
	  are possible, and there are many that do not even make sense
	  (like --backup with --vfsdir) that are not complained about.

	  The --exec option is now left in a strange position. When
	  pilot-xfer acted upon each argument in turn from left (argv[1])
	  to right (argv[argc-1]), doing a system() between two other
	  actions might have made sense.  Now, since we collect arguments
	  and act on them _after_ initial processing where the position of
	  the options is lost, --exec doesn't have a specific spot where it
	  should be executed, eg.

		  --port /dev/pilot *.prc --exec /bin/halt *.pdb --install

	  is also a valid command-line, and there's no way to tell that
	  that exec was "supposed" to happen between the prcs and the pdbs.

	  from Swiss-army-knife behavior with messages; all SAK actions can
	  be specified multiple times, so you can do -D /slot1/ -i foo.c -i
	  bar.c -d blurfl.c -P to install two files to SD card, delete one,
	  then purge databases.

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: You can now -i(nstall) more than one file, just
	  like merge and delete.  Removed totalsize calculation bug.
	  Introduced silly message at end if all you do is install files.

	  Next up: discombobulate functionality into _either_ -burs, all of
	  which run only once after option processing, _or_ -ifmd which may
	  perform many actions on the device.

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: Refactor a little to a VFSRootPath finder that

	  like to factor the install and list parts out into something more
	  library-like (ie. no dependence on global varialbes like sd and
	  vfsdir) so that it's immediately reusable in the GUI bits.

2004-10-24 08:14  adridg

	* include/pi-util.h: One I'm not entirely sure about: define
	  pi_mktag and an inverse in one central place, so we could lose
	  the defines in (almost) every userland conduit, as well as bits
	  of code here and there (like piloe-xfer.c:451).

2004-10-23 20:01  adridg

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: Initial VFS support. Add a -D /vfs/dir option,
	  in order to indicate that whatever operation is selected for
	  pilot-xfer should apply to VFS instead of the usual (databases, I
	  guess). Implemented for listing (-L) only, so far.

	  Usage:

	  pilot-xfer -L -D /	  Lists the "fake root" of VFS dirs on the
	  Pilot. This will show      the SD slots and whatnot returned by
	  VFSVolumeEnumerate. For each	    slot, the slot number is used
	  as a directory name _and_ the volume	    label, if any. In
	  addition, slot information is printed.  pilot-xfer -L -D /slot1/
	      Lists the root directory of the card in slot 1.
	  Alternatively,      if the FS in that slot has a volume label,
	  you can use the name	    of the volume.  pilot-xfer -L -D
	  /slot1/DCIM/100MLT08/      Lists the files in that directory.

	  As a special case, if there is exactly one slot (test case: T5?
	  Tapwave?) and the first path component matches none of the slots
	  / volumes present, it is assumed to be a path in /slot1 (ie. if
	  all else fails, use /slot1 as root), so the following works as
	  well:

	  pilot-xfer -L -D /DCIM/100MLT08

	  Not visible in pilot-xfer help yet.

	  PalmOS 5.2.1 and 5.2.8 PalmOne PDAs, which happen to use

	* src/pilot-addresses.c: Removed some dead code.  This doesn't

	  there is one track for the code to follow.  Yet unresolved issues
	  are:	- table headings may be broken still (didn't check)  - The
	  augment option produces completely useless output still  - The
	  option not to escape data produces broken CSV, so it probably
	  should be disabled.	- CSV is braintead and useless as an
	  interchange format since it's so     completely mind-numbingly
	  useless that everyone seems to have their own     idea of how to
	  "support" things it was never designed to.   - Given the above,
	  no amount of work on this codebase will ever make it	   useful
	  and bug-free, ever.  The optimal solution is to cease using CSV
	  data, with prejudice.

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: use malloc() instead of fixed-size stack buffer
	  for file paths in Backup(). unlink() file if pi_file_retrieve()
	  failed. Exit if socket is disconnected before end of backup.

2004-08-05 14:51  fpillet

	* libpisock/slp.c: Fixed bug #244: allocate slp_buf using malloc()
	  instead of the stack to guarantee proper alignment (was
	  segfaulting on sparc)

2004-08-05 14:30  fpillet

	* libpisock/net.c: Integrated patch for bug #1174 (receiving a
	  PI_TICKLE would disrupt reception of the answer to the last
	  query)

2004-08-05 11:32  fpillet

	* bindings/Perl/Pilot.xs, bindings/Python/src/pisock.i,

2004-08-05 08:56  nicholas

	* bindings/Python/src/: pisock.i, pisock_wrap.c: Compiles again,
	  but _untested_. I thought compiling was at least better than not
	  compiling. Need to look into dealing with callback functions too,
	  should be straight forward, but I've zero copious free time.

2004-08-04 10:14  fpillet

	* include/pi-socket.h, libpisock/socket.c: added
	  pi_socket_connected() entry point

2004-08-04 10:00  fpillet

	  coming from a prototype version of my error reporting stuff

2004-08-03 11:12  fpillet

	  dlp_WriteRecord and didn't support large records. Fixed this.

2004-08-03 03:58  fpillet

	* src/dlpsh.c: properly check for end of dlp_ReadDBList after
	  change in error reporting

2004-08-02 18:13  fpillet

	* src/pilot-xfer.c: fixed the display bugs when backing up files
	  (files where stat()ed before being created)

2004-08-02 04:25  fpillet

	* libpisock/socket.c, include/pi-socket.h: added pi_error() stuff
	  to socket.c, fixed a problem with the PEEK init sequence which
	  was counting too much on an obscure feature of PI_MSG_PEEK on
	  most platforms, fixed another issue with  pi_close().

2004-08-02 04:03  fpillet

	* include/Makefile.am: added pi-error.h to make rules

2004-08-02 04:03  fpillet

	* include/pi-error.h: New pi-error.h file, holding the error code
	  definitions as returned by pi_error() (see pi-socket.h for
	  pi_error())

2004-08-02 04:02  fpillet

	* include/pi-usb.h: removed the 'pos' member of the pi_usb_data
	  structure, nobody uses it

2004-08-02 04:01  fpillet

	* libpisock/freebsdusb.c: rewrote freebsdusb's u_read() function.
	  Note: there was NO timeout handling in either u_read() or
	  u_write() in the original freebsdusb code. I didn't put it back
	  in from the linuxusb source, but someone who can test on freebsd
	  should definitely do it.

2004-08-01 18:52  adridg

	* libpisock/freebsdusb.c: Update function prototypes to support
	  Florent's pi_buffer_t (and so it compiles); u_read is horribly
	  broken though, since it doesn't actually _do_ any of the
	  pi_buffer_t management.

2004-08-01 18:50  fpillet

	* libpisock/unixserial.c: fixed a wrong memcpy I left when I
	  converted unixserial to use pi_buffer_t

2004-07-29 11:39  fpillet

	* libpisock/inet.c: minor cleanup

2004-07-29 11:33  fpillet

	  dlp_request_new/free, dlp_response_new/free; turned a few
	  fprintf()s into LOG; fixed a segfault when receiving >64k records
	  from Palm OS 5 devices under certain conditions

2004-07-27 12:24  desrod

	* bindings/Perl/Pilot.xs: Fix the last two remaining errors and
	  clean up the invalid pointer, using the new pi_buffer_t and the
	  ugliest cast I've ever seen ;)

2004-07-27 04:56  fpillet

	* include/pi-file.h, libpisock/pi-file.c: modified progress
	  callback prototype to return a int. Callbacks can return either
	  PI_TRANSFER_CONTINUE or PI_TRANSFER_STOP, effectively allowing
	  the callback to interrupt a transfer (at least between individual
	  record downloads / uploads)

2004-07-27 02:49  desrod

	* bindings/Perl/Pilot.xs: Crikey, who indented this mess. I'll fix
	  it!

2004-07-27 01:16  desrod

2004-07-26 14:26  fpillet

	* src/pi-nredir.c: fixed issue in pi-nredir: was not rewriting the
	  right piece of data to the distant socket (my bad: was writing
	  buffer instead of buffer->data)

2004-07-23 17:27  knghtbrd

	* src/Makefile.am: use $(POPT_LIBS), not
	  $(top_builddir)/popt/libpopt.la - it might not get built!

2004-07-23 12:49  fpillet

	* bindings/Python/src/pisock_wrap.c, include/pi-file.h,
	  libpisock/pi-file.c, src/pilot-foto.c, src/pilot-xfer.c:

2004-07-23 10:51  fpillet

	* libpisock/dlp.c: ENH: added support for dlpDBListMultiple in
	  dlp_FindDBInfo to speed up operations

2004-07-23 06:15  fpillet

	* libpisock/dlp.c, include/pi-dlp.h: Added support for download and
	  upload of large records. Works/tested with TapWave Zodiac and
	  Palm OS 6 simulator.

2004-07-19 16:35  angusa

	* src/: read-screenshot.c, read-veo.c: Fixed HAVE_PNG defines

2004-07-19 13:46  angusa

2004-07-02 09:50  fpillet

	  dlp_VFSVolumeEnumerate

2004-06-28 14:08  fpillet

	* libpisock/dlp.c: Fixed improper conversion from DLP date to
	  time_t in dlp_ptohdate(). Due to improper conversion, most dates
	  returned were -1. Dates are not correctly returned as a time_t
	  expressed in the machine's current timezone.

2004-06-02 10:22  fpillet

	* darwin/build_framework.sh: added prebinding support when building
	  framework (see usage notes at top of script)

2004-06-01 06:13  nicholas

	* bindings/Python/: README, pisock.py, setup.py.in, src/pisock.i,
	  src/pisock.py, src/pisock_wrap.c: Updated Python bindings to work
	  with Florent's patch (v3), and Swig 1.3.21

2004-05-31 07:49  fpillet

	* darwin/build_framework.sh: fixed linking and internal symlinks

2004-05-30 17:59  warp

	* libpisock/pi-file.c: Er, oops.  Now /this/ is a stupid mistake.

2004-05-30 09:02  fpillet

	* include/Makefile.am: added pi-buffer.h to c_headers

2004-05-29 12:50  warp

	* include/pi-dlp.h, libpisock/dlp.c: Make the dbname argument to

2004-05-28 18:19  fpillet

	* libpisock/: pi-buffer.c, pi-buffer.lo, pi-buffer.o: new
	  pi_buffer_t type and accessor functions

2004-05-27 21:41  knghtbrd

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, libpisock++/Makefile.am: Renamed
	  --with-cpp to --with-cxx to avoid confusion with the preprocessor
	  and made it actually use the compiler argument.  Removed LIBCXX
	  and the check for libstdc++ since the latter isn't portable
	  anyway.  In theory, this should work for everyone.  In practice,
	  the C++ check will probably need to be altered to check a whole
	  bunch of things like the readline check does once people start
	  reporting what breaks.  *sigh*

2004-05-27 18:46  knghtbrd

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, tcl.m4, darwin/.cvsignore,
	  darwin/Makefile.am, libpisock++/Makefile.am, m4/tcl.m4,
	  popt/Makefile.am: More autoconf/automake fixes: make dist works
	  properly again, modern versions of automake no longer complain
	  about unquoted function names in macro declarations, tcl.m4 is no
	  longer installed to the system, and both included and system popt
	  now work.

2004-05-26 15:38  knghtbrd

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, src/Makefile.am: Rewrote the popt
	  configure.in stuff a bit so that it actually works the way it
	  should.  (There may be a residual bug or two, working on them!)

2004-05-26 03:28  knghtbrd

	* configure.in, m4/vl_lib_readline.m4: Made the readline check
	  better..

2004-05-26 01:32  knghtbrd

	* libpisock/: darwinusb.c, usb.c: The Zire 72 shares 0061 with the

2004-05-25 03:29  knghtbrd

	* configure.in, src/dlpsh.c: Fix potential NULL dereference
	  (readline returns NULL at EOF)

2004-05-25 03:09  knghtbrd

	* Makefile.am, acinclude.m4, autogen.sh, m4/tcl.m4,
	  m4/vl_lib_readline.m4, src/dlpsh.c: Made some changes to auto*
	  build system:  - Created m4/ and moved tcl.m4 into it (gets rid
	  of acinclude.m4)  - Added m4/vl_lib_readline.m4 - better readline
	  finding  - made existing stuff work with new readline detection
	  - configure --without-cpp no longer forces you to have libstdc++
	  anyway

2004-05-25 01:50  knghtbrd

	* libpisock/connect.c: Add missing "

2004-05-24 09:15  desrod

	  libpisock/inet.c, libpisock/libusb.c, libpisock/serial.c,
	  libpisock/socket.c, libpisock/usb.c, src/dlpsh.c: Fixed the fd
	  leak problem with a chainsaw, removing all device duplication
	  code.

	  Reverted connect.c to the pre-mace version, with some changes.

	  NOTE!  This changes the pi_accept API, it now returns the sd
	  passed to it, instead of making a duplicate of it and returning
	  that, this will have an impact on all programs which try to treat
	  the 'parent' sd and the 'client' sd differently.

	  Fixed a libusb reopening bug.

	  Added the (very hacky) reopen command to dlpsh, to test reopening
	  the link to the PDA.

2004-05-15 05:22  knghtbrd

	* configure.in: Changes related to CFLAGS and friends:
	  Moved/rewrote the MacOS X fink test, added compiler defaults for
	  GCC, removed AC_SUBST of compiler flags because it's not
	  necessary, added CPPFLAGS to configure summary.

2004-05-14 22:29  desrod

	* configure.in: Bump to rc8, soname bump

2004-05-14 22:00  desrod

2004-05-12 14:53  desrod

	* include/pi-net.h, libpisock/net.c: (Patch from Florent Pillet)

	  - adds bounds checking to net_rx (see comments I added to the
	  net_rx function)

	  - fixes issue where receive buffer needed to add 6 bytes for
	  temporary header   (the packet header is now read into a separate
	  buffer). You'd get a crash   if you call pi_read() with a buffer
	  of the exact expected size, for example.

2004-05-12 04:25  fpillet

	* include/pi-dlp.h: added opcode values next to dlp func defines to
	  ease reading packet traces

2004-05-10 20:07  knghtbrd

	* configure.in: Fix my half-edited --help test for configure

2004-05-10 19:56  fpillet

	* include/pi-dlp.h, libpisock/dlp.c, tests/vfs-test.c: VFS
	  functions tested & fixed

2004-05-10 17:27  angusa

	* src/read-veo.c: Added png output.  Single picture output
	  Histogram adjustment Comments

2004-05-10 04:35  fpillet

	* libpisock/darwinusb.c: comments & define tweaks

2004-05-09 20:30  knghtbrd

	* libpisock/darwinusb.c: Some comments got lost in moving things
	  around.  I don't have Florent's more verbose comments in front of
	  me, but this will help make some sense of the variables.

2004-05-09 20:28  knghtbrd

	* configure.in: Better handling of -Werror set in the environment

2004-05-09 06:26  knghtbrd

	* include/pi-palmpix.h, include/pi-sync.h, libpisock/palmpix.c,
	  src/install-memo.c, src/memos.c, src/pi-getromtoken.c,
	  src/pi-nredir.c, src/pilot-addresses.c, src/pilot-archive.c,

	  src/pilot-wav.c, src/pilot-xfer.c, src/read-notepad.c,
	  src/read-palmpix.c, src/read-todos.c, tests/versamail-test.c:
	  Most compiler warnings issued with -Wall are fixed.
	  test-versamail and pilot-datebook still have a few, but perhaps
	  someone else can squash them?

2004-05-08 19:01  knghtbrd

	* configure.in, darwin/build_framework.sh, include/Makefile.am,
	  include/darwinusbcore.h, libpisock/Makefile.am,
	  libpisock/darwinusb.c, libpisock/darwinusbcore.cpp: Need to
	  commit this so I can move on.  It seems to break nothing,
	  although it undoes one small change Florent made to Darwin's USB
	  code which broke it for me.

2004-05-08 05:52  knghtbrd

	* libpisock/: connect.c, inet.c, net.c, socket.c: Excepting
	  darwinusb (which is waiting on Florent and David to test my
	  patch), this will make libpisock -Wall -Werror clean on a Mac.

2004-05-08 04:57  knghtbrd

	  src/addresses.c, src/dlpsh.c, src/pilot-addresses.c,
	  src/pilot-xfer.c: Some compiler warning fixes from Florent that
	  got lost in the shuffle..

2004-05-08 04:40  knghtbrd

	* configure.in: AC_TYPE_SIGNAL produces a compiler warning.  If
	  -Werror is set, this warning can cause RETSIGTYPE to be set to
	  int on systems where it should be void.  This causes the code to
	  issue a warning, which produces a compile error.  Vicious cycle
	  go splat!  (The workaround is a bit hackish, but it's
	  autoconf--what can you do?)

2004-05-07 21:59  warp

	* configure.in, libpisock/Makefile.am, libpisock/libusb.c: libusb
	  support, use --enable-libusb.

2004-05-07 02:51  fpillet

	* libpisock/darwinusbcore.cpp: use the regular InterfaceInterface
	  (don't need v182), fixed a leak in start_listening, added check
	  for PalmConnect USB, fixed a return request buffer size for close
	  notification

2004-05-07 02:49  fpillet

	* libpisock/darwinusb.c: fixed prototypes in darwinusb (patch not
	  applied by David)

2004-05-06 16:23  knghtbrd

	* configure.in, libpisock/Makefile.am, src/install-netsync.c:
	  pilot-link now compiles on MacOS X, though with many warnings
	  yet.	This code walks over one of Florent's unapplied patches a
	  bit, but is the more correct fix anyway.  Darwin users *must*
	  make distclean; ./autogen.sh all over again to ensure that
	  libtool works.

2004-05-06 15:40  warp

	* autogen.sh: Fix it some more.

2004-05-06 15:16  warp

	* autogen.sh, src/pilot-xfer.c: Fix autogen on my box.

	  Actually increment totalsize.

	  Java/Perl5 directories). Sorry about that, it's all better now.

		  Note: The license for the pisock library, the C++ libary,
	  and
			the Perl, Python, Tcl, and Java bindings have been
			covered under the LGPL since August 23, 1998.

		  1. Added a 'mem' option to dlpsh. I will eventually add a
		     'password' function, version (OS version), and some
	  other
		     tweaks. I've put up some detailed information on how
	  to extract
		     this password from the Palm on the pilot-link site on
		     gnu-designs.com when I get a free moment.

		  2. I nuked the Palm regex I did in pre1. Basically pre1
	  was a
		     s/PilotRecord/PalmRecord/g (and others), and this
	  release I
		     reversed that action. Too many things would have been
	  adversely
		     affected for this to be practical at the onset. If we
	  feel that
		     having 'Pilot' in the name doesn't violate what Palm
	  has
		     legally stated about using the name Pilot, then it
	  should stay.
		     If we feel that there could be some legal issues, we
	  would need
		     to rename most of the code and package name itself,
	  i.e. BAD!

		  3. Since there was a possible issue about the copyright
	  status of
		     the code in sync.c, jpr and myself have completely
	  gutted it
		     and did a ground-up rewrite of the code. In
	  libsock/sync.c
		     we've implemented the following interfaces:

		     (sync_Synchronize): Do a full blown sync
		     (sync_MergeToRemote): Sync desktop records to pilot.
		     (sync_MergeToRemote_slow): Implement slow sync of
	  above
		     (sync_MergeToRemote_fast): Implement fast sync of
	  above
		     (sync_MergeFromRemote): Sync pilot records to desktop
		     (sync_MergeFromRemote_slow): Implement slow sync of
	  above
		     (sync_MergeFromRemote_fast): Implement fast sync of
	  above
		     (sync_CopyFromRemote): Copy pilot records to desktop
		     (sync_CopyToRemote): Copy desktop records to pilot
		     (sync_record): Sync a desktop and pilot record
		     (store_record_on_palm): Utility routine

		     Also, include/pi-sync.h was rewritten to implement a
	  generic
		     sync algorithm

		     include/pi-macros.h now has included <time.h> for
	  struct tm

		     include/pi-dlp.h has now exposed the DLP_BUF_SIZE
	  macro

		  4. All appropriate FSF headers have been plopped into the
	  files
		     where appropriate. All originating authorship and
	  copyrights
		     were retained in the files, and where there was no
	  definitive
		     author, I've replaced it with 'Copyright (c)
	  1997-2000, The
		     pilot-link team'. This should make it very clear which
	  files
		     are not proprietary (as was the previous sync.c
	  implementation)

		  5. include/pi-header.h has been nuked, and replaced with
	  a cleaner
		     pi-header.c function, which exposes PalmHeader().

		  6. The beginnings of the longopt() conversion is in the
	  code as
		     well, so we can mash out the "ASCII art" that John
	  mentioned.
		     The "Palm Splash" will only show up on a --version
	  call, not
		     when using --help.

		  7. A bad BSD nm test in ./configure was nuked and
	  replaced with a
		     much cleaner working version of the test.

		  8. Two quick tweaks to Perl5/Makefile.PL and
	  Makefile.PL.in to
		     allow it to cleanly build on perl-5.005 and later
	  versions
		     w.r.t. prototypes and namespace.

		  9. include/pi-sync.h: Some renaming, add pre and post
	  sync
		     callback struct members.

		 10. libsock/sync.c: (close_db): Don't just close the db,
	  clean it
		     up and reset the sync flags.

	  doc/man/read-ical.1:
	  A ton of changes in this release. Below is a small list:

		  Here's a short list of what I've done (by no means
	  complete)

		  1. I changed PilotUser to PalmUser in all relevant
	  places. This
		     had no direct affect on the code, but I'm doing this
	  so that
		     future plugins will function in a more "generic" way,
	  not bound
		     to "Pilot" devices specifically. Though this does not
	  affect
		     pilot-link, the authors of code which uses that must
	  now put an
		     #ifndef in their code when testing for versions of
	  pilot-link
		     (0.9.3 will use PilotUser, versions > 0.9.3 will now
	  use
		     PalmUser.

		  2. Added proper error trapping in pi_bind for all
	  programs which
		     used it, so incorrect port settings can be trapped,
	  and the
		     user notified. In some cases, you would just get
	  "Error:
		     pi_bind", which is not that descriptive. Fixed.

		  3. Added the ability to sync PQA files from PalmVII and
	  PalmVIIx
		     units. There were other things in the patch Tom sent
	  me which I
		     tried to integrate, but a -U option was conflicting
	  with
		     another option, so I had to rename (the other)  option
	  to -I. I
		     do not have a PalmVIIx, only a PalmVII, so if someone
	  has a
		     VIIx, please test this and get back to me.

		  4. Added a "-a <dir>" option to archive (move) deleted
	  files
		     (during a "-s" sync command) to the specified
	  directory, rather
		     than just deleting them.

		  5. Added the Graffiti Shortcuts fix to pi-file.c and
	  pilot-xfer.c

		  6. Added a -F option to toggle the Backup code between
	  backing up
		     the RAM databases, and the ones in ROM.  With the
	  advent of
		     FlashbuilderIII and now FlashPro, user apps may be
	  hiding in
		     the Flash ROM of a Palm III/IIIx/V.  When the "rom"
	  databases
		     are being backed up, the code skips over any which
	  have a
		     creator that is composed entirely of lowercase letters
	  and/or
		     "_".  This should keep the standard built-in apps from
		     needlessly getting backed up (since Palm has claimed
	  this
		     entire class of creator ids for themselves).

		  7. Also added a corresponding -O option which is sort of
	  the
		     opposite of -F -- it backs up ONLY the Flash (or ROM)
	  databases
		     which have creator ids composed entirely of lowercase
	  letters
		     and/or "_". (My use for this was to be able to run
	  prc2pilrc on
		     various of the PalmOS databases to see exactly how
	  their forms
		     were laid out.

		  8. Added a -q option which avoids printing out all the
		     "Skipping..." messages.  This way, if you only have a
	  few
		     databases that need to be synced, the output won't
	  scroll off
		     the screen, and it will be easier to see what has
	  actually been
		     done.

		  9. Added a -c option which falls partway between -q and
	  the
		     previous behavior: for each database examined, "[ ##
	  ]" (where
		     ## is a monotonically increasing index number) is
	  printed at
		     the beginning of the line, with a "\r" but no "\n".
	  The effect
		     of this is to make evident that the backup code is
	  skipping
		     past lots of databases that don't need backing up.

		 10. Changed the default behavior to no longer back up the
	  database
		     named "Unsaved Preferences".  Apparently, Palm asked
	  the
		     creator of BackupBuddy to make this change in his
	  code, as
		     restoring this database can cause trouble version 3.1
	  of
		     PalmOS.

		 11. Added a -I option to revert to the original behavior
	  of
		     considering the "Unsaved Preferences" database for
	  backup. This
		     was originally a -U option, but the -U(pdate) option
	  made more
		     sense there. I named this one -I for -I(llegal)
	  databases.
		     *shrug* I couldn't think of a better one at the time.
	  =)

		 12. Changed the "Backup done." message to say either "RAM
	  backup
		     done.", "Flash backup done.", or "OS backup done", as
		     appropriate.

		 13. Modified dlp_ptohdate() to return a date outside of
	  the Pilot's
		     valid range of dates when fed a date with a zero year
	  field.
		     This zero year field seems to mean "never", or "no
	  date".

		 14. Added BSD/NetBSD to the list of systems for which the
		     sleeping_beauty define gets set.

		 15. Added a "-f file" option, to read memos from a
	  MemoDB.pdb file
		     that is already on-disk, rather than syncing them from
	  the
		     Palm.  Stole the idea, and most of the code, from
	  read-todos.

		 16. Added a -Q option, which prevents
	  write_memo_in_directory from
		     printing its "Opening file ..." messages.

		 17. Fixed (admittedly with a hack) the pi_accept timeout
	  errors by
		     ignoring the 10th packet. Once we start to gut this
	  code, this
		     will be fixed in a proper fashion. For this release,
	  it would
		     have affected too much other reliant code, so I
	  implemented the
		     hack instead.

		 18. Increased the PATH_MAX for the device name in
		     libsock/libsockaddr.h.in to [255]. This needs to be
	  more
		     portable, but for the meantime, this will get everyone
	  by.

		 19. Added a -D, -T, and -t option to pilot-addresses. You
	  can now
		     output the file with headers intact. There's a small
	  buglet
		     here I'm tracking down, but it works in very basic
	  manner, and
		     I didn't break the previous working code, so consider
	  this
		     transitory.

		 20. Added pi-header.h to the files which could use it.
	  This adds a
		     bit of similarity (visually) to the application, as
	  well as
		     outputs the proper binary being used, and it's version
	  number.
		     Now all the binaries when run look the same.

		 21. Cleaned up the "Help()" and "Usage()" functions to
	  output
		     visually similar results. Some of the binaries had
	  options
		     which were not in the output of --help. I am going to
	  continue
		     adding longopt[] to the remaining code in place of
	  getopt, for
		     those which require it. There's also a lingering issue
	  with the
		     name of the port being 'device' in some places,
	  'argv[0]' in
		     others, 'addr.pi_device' in some places, and 'port'
	  still in
		     others. Should clean that up and make a call to
	  pi-device or
		     some such.

		 22. Removed all of the relvant entries to "Pilot" in the
	  code and
		     replaced them with "Palm" where appropriate, as well
	  as nuked
		     the references to "US Robotics" from the man pages,
	  source
		     code, and other ancillary files.

		 23. Added the 'null date' fix to install-datebook to allow
	  proper
		     dating of units which exceed Palm threshholds or those
	  which
		     have no date.

		 24. Added a fix for databases > 255, so you can sync 256
	  or more
		     databases to your Palm, without crashing.

		  Please note a significant (but minor) change: the license
	  for the hinote
		  code in the pisock library has been changed to LGPL. In
	  the previous

	  library from being
		  used in an LGPL manner. If you wish to use the pisock
	  library with the
		  LGPL license, please base your work on 0.9.2.

		  Rewrote pilot-dedupe in a more sensible manner. (New
	  version could have
		  some bugs.)

		  Added Tilo's changes to support "high" baud rates with
	  PILOTRATE
		  environment variable.  Say "PILOTRATE=H115200" to specify
	  a high rate.
		  PILOTHIGHRATE variable is now ignored.

		  Added Tilo's pi_setmaxspeed() function, and added initial
		  pi_getsockopt() support to retrieve current speed.

		  Changed Python detection to support 1.5.1 installation.

	  Kenneth Albanowski	  0.9.1

		  Hi-Notes support (in 'hinotes' and 'install-hinote',
	  courtesy of Bill
		  Goodman, and Michael Bravo.)

		  Install-memo improvements.

		  read-ical improvements (?) regarding secret records and
	  alarms.

		  Fixed pi-getrom's decoding of ROM version. (3.0 units
	  should now
		  download complete ROM image.)

		  Installation of databases fixed to allow uploading of
	  databases with
		  zero-length resources.

		  Direct support for "high" (nominally unsupported) baud
	  rates via
		  PILOTHIGHRATE environment variable.

		  Please note a significant change: the license for the

		  the C++ libary, and the Perl, Python, Tcl, and Java
	  bindings has been
		  changed from the GPL (GNU Public License) to the LGPL
	  (Library GNU

		  and COPYING.

		  If you have any reason to disagree with this change,
	  please contact me
		  as soon as possible. I have attempted to verify with all
	  affected
		  parties that this change is acceptable.

		  This license change applies starting with release 0.9.0
	  of pilot-link.
		  This change is not retroactive, and previous releases
	  (0.8.13, and
		  before) are still available, with all parts under the
	  GPL.

	  In other news:

		  pi-getrom fixed to get 2 Meg of ROM on a 3.0 device (by
	  working around a
		  bug in PalmOS 3.0.)

		  read-todos modified to work with both a ToDoDB.pdb file
	  (as downloaded
		  from the device), as well as the database on the device.

		  Tcl binding changed to remove "Pilot" from name. (I'm
	  only changing Tcl
		  at the moment, because nothing could possibly be relying
	  on it.)

		  Not much work has gone into pilot-link since the previous
	  release, the
		  main changes being several patches that have been
	  applied:

		  David Warren's <dsw@comfortably-numb.engr.sgi.com> fix
	  for reminds.c.

		  Dag Nygren's <dag@newtech.fi> tickles for sync-plan.

		  Russell Nelson's <nelson@crynwr.com> patches for
	  pilot-mail.

		  Bodo Bellut's <bodo@garfield.ping.de> patch for pi-file
	  to better catch
		  errors.

		  Jay Sekora's <js@aq.org> improved memos and
	  pilot-addresses.

		  Rik Harris's <Rik.Harris@fulcrum.com.au> patch to get
	  pi-port working.

		  Fixed libsock/socket.c to not crash on
	  unbound/unconnected socket.

		  Added Rui Oliveira's <rco@di.uminho.pt> MoneyManager
	  code.

		  Removed Java bin build directory stuff, it was broken.

		  Also, I've decided that getopt() was a complete loss
	  where pilot-xfer is
		  concerned, so it now has manual argument processing. I
	  rather expect the
		  new code is buggy, too, but at least it will be the same
	  bugs for
		  everyone.

		  Lastly, I've added the latest release of libtool, 1.2.
	  This should fix
		  some problems, but might well cause others. Let me know,
	  of course.

		  Configuration changes:
		    - Added dependancy checking to utilties.
		    - Touched up OS/2 configuration slightly.
		    - Added detection of uname and other SunOS (or was it
	  Solaris?) foibles.
		  Pisocket library changes:
		    - Changes to nearly all structure definitions, though
	  these are mostly
		      just changes to the names of members. The names have
	  been changed to
		      follow a common naming scheme ("thisIsAMethod",
	  "ramSize", etc.),
		      to remove chopped words, and to let the interpreter
	  bindings use the
		      same member names as the C code. The new names are
	  frozen (I hope)
		      and will not change again.
		    - Category information has been broken out of the
	  appInfo structures
		      into a separate structure, since it was producing
	  needless
		      duplicated code.
		    - All of the database record packing code had been
	  tuned and tested,
		      and now pay attention to their arguments. In
	  particular, both the
		      packers and unpackers return how many bytes were used
	  (or zero if
		      the buffer wasn't long enough), and the packer will
	  return the
		      desired buffer length if it is passed a buffer
	  address of zero.
		      These changes allow programs to let the packer
	  calculate how much
		      buffer space should be allocated.
		    - Version number of shared library bumped up to
	  indicate incompatible changes.
		  Test code changes:
		    - Added test code to check all packers and unpackers
	  for proper operation.
		  Utility changes:
		    - Added pi-getrom program to fetch a Pilot's ROM
	  through RPC calls.
		      Be careful, this program _could_ cause your Pilot to
	  lock up, so
		      back up first. But I'd love to hear about any
	  problems.
		    - pi-csd tries to get the host name via uname if
	  gethostname isn't available.
		    - Added backlight support to remote UI in pilot-debug.
		    - Added Ian G.'s pilot-debug patches to support pasting
	  text into the remote UI.
		    - All utilities modified to match changes to pisocket
	  library.
		  Java binding changes:
		    - Dlp exceptions now contain (through hard effort) the
	  Dlp error value
		    - Use slightly less deprecated Date interface (bleagh!)
		    - Structures modified to match new definitions.
		    - Added resetNext & callApplication methods.
		    - Adapted packers to new structures -- broke off
	  categories into
		      a subclass of AppBlock.
		    - Added support for all standard databases except
	  Expense.
		    - Changed toString mechanism to allow superclasses to
	  build up description.
		    - Added newRecord, newResource, newAppBlock,
	  newSortBlock and newPref methods.
		    - Java structures and methods are freezing if not
	  frozen.
		  Perl 5 binding changes:
		    - Structures modified to match new definitions.
		    - Perl structures and methods are freezing if not
	  frozen.
		    - Renamed methods to match Java binding ("likeThis",
	  "ramSize", "getRecord", etc.)
		  Python binding changes:
		    - Structures modified to match new definitions.
		    - Python structures and methods are freezing if not
	  frozen.
		    - Renamed methods to match Java binding.

		  Configuration changes:
		    - No more complaints if the Java Development Kit isn't
	  installed.
		    - sockaddr.sa_len member is detected (for pi-csd)
		  Pisocket library changes:
		    - Support for Palm's TCP/IP NetSync(tm) has been added.
	  To use this,
		      give a program like pilot-xfer a port of '.' (a
	  single period). You
		      will also need to run (perhaps in the background)
	  pi-csd, with its
		      settings configured to match the PC NetSync(tm)
	  settings on your
		      PalmPilot(tm).
		    - Leak of laddr/raddr members fixed.
		  Utility changes:
		    - Added pi-csd program to allow network
	  synchronization. This program
		      must be running for your computer to accept
	  NetSync(tm) connections
		      from a PalmPilot(tm). You must of course also run
	  whatever utility
		      or synchronization program you want the PalmPilot(tm)
	  to connect to.
		    - Added pi-nredir to allow a normal (or network, for
	  that matter)
		      connection to be redirected over the network to
	  pilot-link or the
		      PalmPilot(tm) Desktop.
		    - Read-ical patches by Ian G. applied, allowing use of
	  a default port,
		      and a method of hiding the text of datebook entries.
		  Java binding changes:
		    - Todo application supported.
		    - You can now open a database using an instance of
	  Pdapilot.Database
		      instead of a database name.

		  Configuration changes:
		    - Uninstalled binaries should better cope with symlinks
	  or moving
		      their directory.
		    - The Java Development Kit is automatically detected.
		  Build changes:
		    - Man pages probably can be installed now
		    - Added Mike Jarabek's latest OS/2 patches, which
	  should allow a
		      shared libpisock dll to be built and used.
		  Pisoket library changes:
		    - Mail preferences renamed from "MailPrefs" to
	  "MailPref1".
		    - Corrected bug in retrieving NetSync info if fields
	  were empty.
		  Utility changes:
		    - Modified pilot-undelete slightly to match new Perl5
	  module.
		    - Added pilot-xfer patches (slightly modified) by
	  Christopher Chan-Nui
		      <channui@austin.ibm.com>. These allow default port
	  via PILOTPORT,
		      and multiple files/db's with a command.
		  Java binding changes:
		    - New! All of the libpisock functionality is accessible
	  from the Java
		      interpreter. The only missing parts are RPC,
	  CallApplication, and
		      the packers other then Memo.
		  Perl 5 binding changes:
		    - Completely revised record storage mechanism uses
	  objects to describe
		      records, resources, appblocks, sortblocks, and prefs.
		      All current code using the Perl5 module will need to
	  be rewritten,
		      though the changes will probably be minimal.
		      The upshot of this change is that record
	  packing/unpacking is now
		      automated.
		  Python binding changes:
		    - Preferences may be retrieved from an open DB.

		  Configuration changes:
		    - Integrated libtool 1.0 (thanks, Gord!)
		    - Automatic detection of GNU readline 2.0 and 2.1 (or
	  later).
		    - libtool removed entirely from C++ section
		    - Itcl automatically detected, and tcl/tk from an itcl
	  installation
		      will be detected. Itcl is not currently used,
	  however.
		    - Adjusted to (re)support OS/2 compilation.
		    - Revised OS/2 makefiles by Mike Jarabek.
		  Pisocket library changes:
		    - Fixed up a few headers to use PI_ARGS.
		    - Added compareTm function to compare tm's.
		  Utilities:
		    - pilot-debug can now automatically utilise GNU
	  readline 2.0 or 2.1
		      for decent line-editing support, and in theory
	  anything past 2.1
		      should work as well.
		    - pilot-mail includes patches by Diego Zamboni
	  <diegoz@labsec.Corp.Sun.COM>
		      to support reading of MH mail folders. (Note: this
	  code does not
		      support file or folder locking, or non-contiguous
	  message numbers.)
		  Perl 5 binding changes:
		    - various dlp constants are now exported by PDA::Pilot.
		    - CompareTm function exportable which takes two tm
	  style listrefs
		      and returns <0, 0, or >0.
		    - Fixed nasty bugs on packing appointments with alarms
	  (alarm wouldn't
		      trigger properly), and on appointments without
	  descriptions
		      (Datebook would crash).
		    - Modified typemap so module will not fail on earlier
	  versions of Perl.
		  Python binding changes:
		    - SetRecord now takes an optional second argument. If a
	  non-zero integer,
		      the record will not be packed, and only the "raw"
	  attribute will
		      be used.
		  Tcl binding changes:
		    - Large chunks rewritten to increase functionality.
		    - Small, subtle, incomprehensible, and potentially
	  bug-ridden chunks rewritten
		      to make channel code compatible with versions of Tcl
	  prior to 8.0.
		    - "make test" should work.
		    - GetRecord and SetRecord commands supported, with
	  packer support.
		    - Only memo records currently have packer support.
	  Databases without defined
		      packers cannot be read.

		  Heavily modifed Python binding to use OO approach to
	  record manipulation
			  and packing. Read the README and test.py files in

			  directory for more information.
		  Added 'struct sockaddr;' reference to pi-socket.h to
	  allow use by code
			  that has not pulled in the full set of socket
	  headers.
		  Added to configure the --with-cpp and --with-perl5
	  options to allow

			  5 interpreter, respectively. ('onfigure --help'

		  Removed shared library generation from C++ library (it
	  has too much of a

	* .gdb_history: Jun 14, 1997	Kenneth Albanowski 0.7.0

		  Substantial modification to socket implementation. The

			  layers now have significantly more separation and
	  modularity, with
			  the goal of allowing clean serial
	  implementations, across both
			  architectures (os2, amiga, unix, etc.) and

			  serial, networked serial redirector, etc.). A
	  higher layer will
			  allow for connections that do not use the serial
	  interface and
			  protocols at all, though this is not utilized in
	  this version.
		  All pi_ functions that deal with addresses now use
	  sockaddr struct *
			  params instead of pi_sockaddr. Any C programs
	  using pilot-link
			  directly will need to be modified. The parameter
	  is still a
			  pi_sockaddr, but it must be cast to (struct
	  sockaddr*), as with the
			  genuine socket functions.
		  The pi_port element has been removed from the pi_sockaddr
	  structure. Any
			  C code constructing these structures will have to
	  be modified.
		  All included programs and language bindings have been
	  modified as
			  described above.
		  SLP, PADP, and syspackets recoded slightly to better deal
	  with xid
			  generation.
		  The OS/2 and UNIX serial code was stripped out of
	  serial.c, and placed
			  into os2serial.c and unixserial.c. If you wish to
	  port the serial
			  layer, please do so in a new file (amigaserial.c,
	  etc.)
		  Added '-2' switch to getrom, which should retrieve the
	  entire ROM if
			  a PalmPilot and getrom2.prc are used.
		  Getrom2.prc included from the latest version of CoPilot
	  (I hope Greg

		  (Type "mirror", then show the Remote UI window, and play

	  event loop from
		      plus-patch, and removed Tk dependancy -- pilot-debug
	  is now usable
		      with or without Tk! That means debugsh is officially

		  Added Matthew Schnee's latest OS/2 patches.
		  Changed default connection rate to 9600 from 19200. (For
	  some reason
		      19200 now doesn't seem to be working on my machine. I

		     have not been able to deduce how to invoke RPC under

		     will stay unimplemented until somebody comes up with

	  records.
		  _Also_ added patch to stop ignore records on database
	  retrieval that

		 quality, and should be used as the basis for all attempts

	      Added Pace's pdump, modified and renamed to pilot-file, which

		dumping and exploring .pdb and .prc files.
	      Wrote and tested sync.c abstract synchronization layer. All
	  but category
		synchronization and the detail of when to use which sync
	  type is implemented.
	      Fleshed out sync-memodir program which can now successfully
	  synchronize a
		Pilot with a "memo directory", a directory containing text
	  files.
	      (sync-ical is still useless stub)
	      Integrated Bill Sommerfeld's patches for read-ical, padp, and
	  syspkt.

	      -- Removed sync code based on Palm algorithms, pending
	  approval from
		 Palm/USR. What remains is sufficient to overwrite one side
	  with
		 another, and to serve as a framework if people who have
	  not seen Palm
		 code want to implement their own algorithms.

		 Quoting from lib/sync.c:

		 * Revised revision: all sections of code directly derived
	  (albeit in a
		 * paraphased manner) from code in the Palm Conduit SDK,
	  _which are not
		 * blatently obvious and irreducible_ have been temporarily
	  removed until
		 * word is obtained from Palm that the code may be
	  publically released.
		 *
		 * The issue that needs to be resolved is whether Palm
	  Computing Inc. will
		 * allow the public distribution of source code derived
	  from source code in
		 * their Pilot PC Conduit SDK. The licensing information
	  that I recieved
		 * with the PC and Mac SDKs is not sufficient to resolve
	  this question.
		 *
		 * In keeping with the sprit of the EU practice for reverse
	  engineering, the
		 * interface that I have designed to plug into the Palm
	  algorithms has been
		 * retained.

		 manipulate Pilot files, as well as the stock mechanism for
	  backing
		 up a Pilot via Unix.)
	      Added Pace's pdump, modified and renamed to pilot-file, which
	  is used for
		dumping and exploring .pdb and .prc files.
	      Wrote and tested sync.c abstract synchronization layer. All
	  but category
		synchronization and the detail of when to use which sync
	  type is implemented.
	      Fleshed out sync-memodir program which can now successfully
	  synchronize a
		Pilot with a "memo directory", a directory containing text
	  files.
	      (sync-ical is still useless stub)
	      Integrated Bill Sommerfeld's patches for read-ical, padp, and
	  syspkt.

	      -- Removed sync code based on Palm algorithms, pending
	  approval from
		 Palm/USR. What remains is sufficient to overwrite one side
	  with
		 another, and to serve as a framework if people who have
	  not seen Palm
		 code want to implement their own algorithms.

		 Quoting from lib/sync.c:

		 * Revised revision: all sections of code directly derived
	  (albeit in a
		 * paraphased manner) from code in the Palm Conduit SDK,
	  _which are not
		 * blatently obvious and irreducible_ have been temporarily
	  removed until
		 * word is obtained from Palm that the code may be
	  publically released.
		 *
		 * The issue that needs to be resolved is whether Palm
	  Computing Inc. will
		 * allow the public distribution of source code derived
	  from source code in
		 * their Pilot PC Conduit SDK. The licensing information
	  that I recieved
		 * with the PC and Mac SDKs is not sufficient to resolve
	  this question.
		 *
		 * In keeping with the sprit of the EU practice for reverse
	  engineering, the
		 * interface that I have designed to plug into the Palm
	  algorithms has been
		 * retained.
