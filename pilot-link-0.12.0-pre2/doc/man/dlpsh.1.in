.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdlpsh\fR allows the user to connect to a Palm
handheld and execute arbitrary DLP commands.
.PP
dlpsh can query many different types of information from your Palm
device, such as username, memory capacity, set the time, as well as
other useful functions.
.PP
Once connected, the user may execute most of the
built-in \fIDLP\fR commands. (See \fIBUILT-IN
COMMANDS
\fRbelow for more detail on currently supported
options).
.PP
The connection to the Pilot is kept alive by sending a
\fBPadTickle\fR packet to the Pilot after a small
period of non-activity. (7 seconds by default)
.SH "BUILT-IN COMMANDS"
There are many options available while connected to your Palm
handheld
via \fBdlpsh\fR, including the following.
.PP
\fBuser\fR
.RS 
Print the currently set User information, including Username,
UserID, PCid, and ViewerID. You may also set these values from this
command as well. Use 'user --help' while connected to see details
on how to set or change these values.
.RE
.PP
\fBls\fR
.RS 
Used with \fB\-l\fR and \fB\-r\fR to provide
long and RAM and ROM file lists, similar to the Unix
\&'ls' command. This does not yet allow you
to
narrow your listing to a certain range of files. It will simply
list them all.
.RE
.PP
\fBdf\fR
.RS 
Display how much RAM and ROM is free on your device, again
similar
to the Unix 'df' command. This does not
accept
arguments at this time.
.RE
.PP
\fBtime\fR
.RS 
Set the time on the Palm from the currently-set desktop time.
This
does not work on OS version 3.3, due to a bug in PalmOS at that
time.
.RE
.PP
\fBrm\fR
.RS 
Remove a file and delete it entirely from the Palm device. This
is
an irrevokable process, and you cannot "undelete" a file, once it
has been
deleted with this command.
.RE
.PP
\fBquit\fR
.RS 
Exit the DLP Protocol Shell
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
While in \fBdlpsh\fR, you can always invoke 'help'
or \fB\-\-help\fR to get further information on that
option.
.SH USAGE
The program will connect to your Palm handheld and give the user an
interactive prompt (a "shell") for executing commands across the DLP
\fIHotSync\fR protocol.
