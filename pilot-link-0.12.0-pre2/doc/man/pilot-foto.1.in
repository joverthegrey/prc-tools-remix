.SH PROBLEMS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Palm has not published their database format for the thumbnails. So, pilot-foto puts a generic
penguin thumbnail for every image uploaded. Fotos can be accessed by a named list on the handheld as
well as the thumbnails. This has been tried on a couple of handhelds. It is possible that a foreign
palm or different model will not like it.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
To get a thumbnail image you can copy the jpegs to the memory card. If you copy them back to the
handheld they will have a new thumbnail that matches the jpeg.

.SH BUGS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If a jpeg is installed with the same name as one already on the palm you will have 2 thumbnails
pointing to the same jpeg. The new jpeg will overwrite the old jpeg.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
If the thumbnail fails to install then the jpeg should be removed. It is not.
