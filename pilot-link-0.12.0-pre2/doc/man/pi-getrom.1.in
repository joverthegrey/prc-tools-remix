.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIpi-getrom\fR is used to fetch the ROM from your Palm
handheld for use in debugging Palm applications through the use of
POSE, the
\fBPalm OS Emulator application\fR.
.PP
Note, because \fIpi-getrom\fR uses the low-level RPC
protocol to fetch the ROM image, and the new OS5 devices do not use
this
protocol, you currently cannot fetch an OS5 ROM image using this
utility.
This will be updated in a future release to handle fetching OS5 ROM
images,
using the debugger protocol.

.SH BUGS
.SS "KNOWN BUGS"
\fIpi-getrom\fR does not work with OS5 devices as
yet, due to changes in the architecture and design of the Palm
HotSync
protocol and file type changes from m68k to ARM. Other than that,
\fIpi-getrom\fR has no known bugs at this time.
