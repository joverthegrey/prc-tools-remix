.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
Tokens you may currently extract are:
.RS 
adcc: Entropy for internal A->D convertor calibration
.RE
.RS 
irda: Present only on memory card w/IrDA support
.RE
.RS 
snum: Device serial number (from Memory Card Flash ID)
.RE
.PP
\fIpi-getromtoken\fR is used to fetch the ROM from your
Palm handheld for use in debugging Palm applications through the use
of POSE, the \fBPalm OS Emulator application\fR.
.PP
Note, because \fIpi-getrom\fR uses the low-level RPC
protocol to fetch the ROM image, and the new OS5 devices do not use
this
protocol, you currently cannot fetch an OS5 ROM image using this
utility.
This will be updated in a future release to handle fetching OS5 ROM
images,
using the debugger protocol.

filename will be written out as the rom version name as follows:

.SH BUGS
.SS "KNOWN BUGS"
\fIpi-getrom\fR does not work with OS5 devices as
yet, due to changes in the architecture and design of the Palm
HotSync protocol and file type changes from m68k to ARM. Other
than that, \fIpi-getrom\fR has no known bugs at
this time.
