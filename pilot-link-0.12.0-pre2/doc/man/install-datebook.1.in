.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIinstall-datebook\fR allows the user to create one or
more datebook entries from one or more source files.
.PP
The format of the source file contains one datebook entry per line,
containing four tab separated fields. The fields are start date/time,
end
date/time, alarm settings, and the description of datebook entry. This
program doesn't yet support repeated entries. The date and time must
be in
format understood by \fBparsedate.y\fR. At the very
least,
the following two formats are understood:
.PP
August 11, 1997 0800 GMT+300
.PP
1997/08/11 08:22:33 GMT+300
.PP
If either one of the date and time fields is empty, the entry is
installed without time. If the alarm field is empty, the entry is
installed without setting any alarms. The alarm field can contain
numbers
followed by "m" (minutes), "h" (hours), or "d" (days).
