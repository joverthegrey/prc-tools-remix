.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIpilot-archive\fR is used to print records marked as
"Archive to Desktop" on your Palm handheld to a generic CSV format,
which can be used to create "archive" files on the desktop, if you
choose to do so.
.PP
When you delete data on your Palm device, whether it in in the
Datebook or ToDo or other application, the Palm will prompt you to
"archive" these deleted records. With
\fIpilot-archive\fR, you can store and maintain those
deleted records, if you wish.
.SH OPTIONS

fall back to
\fB/dev/pilot\fR.

.SH USAGE
Connect to a target Palm handheld and return the "archived"
(deleted)
records in your ToDo database in a common, generic CSV format, which
can
be used to create "archive" files on the desktop.
.PP
\fIpilot-archive\fR only speaks to the ToDoDB.pdb file
at this time, but adding support for the other applications is very
trivial. Just look at the code and add your database connection as
required.
.SH EXAMPLES
To output the "deleted" items on your Palm handheld into CSV format
with \fIpilot-archive\fR, simply supply the port
option to \fIpilot-archive\fR and connect to your Palm
device as follows:
.PP
\fIpilot-archive\fR
\fB\-p\fR
\fB/dev/pilot\fR
.PP
\fIpilot-archive\fR will connect to your Palm device,
and output something similar to the following:
.PP
"Category", "Technology", "Priority", "1",
"Completed", "No", "Due", "Sat Dec 20 00:00:00 2003 ",
"Description",
"Mail expense forms to work", "Note", "",
