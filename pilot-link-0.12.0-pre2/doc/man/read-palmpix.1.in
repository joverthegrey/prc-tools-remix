.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIread-palmpix\fR allows a Kodak PalmPix camera user
to extract the images from their Palm handheld and convert them to
Portable Network Graphic (.png) or Portable Pixmap (.ppm) files on
their system. The default output type is Portable Pixmap (.ppm).
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "READ-PALMPIX OPTIONS"
\fB\-b\fR,
\fB\-\-bias\fR \fBbias\fR
.RS 
lighten or darken the image (0..49 darken, 51..100
lighten)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-colour\fR
.RS 
Do a simple colour correction. The colour correction code
makes a
histogram from the image. Using the histogram it then makes up a
couple
of colour tables to try and balance the colours. It also clips
the
top and bottom colours to produce better perceived contrast.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
.RS 
List picture information found on the Palm handheld instead
of converting the entries found to image files.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR
<\fBpixname\fR>
.RS 
Convert only \fBpixname\fR to STDOUT, and output
as
\fBtype\fR: .ppm or .png.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stretch\fR
.RS 
Do a histogram stretch on the colour planes
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR,
\fB\-\-type\fR \fB[ppm|png]\fR
.RS 
Specify the output picture type. Can be either "png" or
"ppm".
.RE
.SS "CONDUIT OPTIONS"
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR
<\fBport\fR>
.RS 
Use device file <\fBport\fR> to communicate
with the Palm handheld. If this is not specified,
\fIread-palmpix\fR will look for the
\fB$PILOTPORT\fR environment variable. If neither
are
found or supplied, \fIread-palmpix\fR will
print the usage information.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 
Suppress 'Hit HotSync button' message
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 
Display version of \fIread-palmpix\fR
and exit without connecting.
.RE
.SS "HELP OPTIONS"
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 
Display the help synopsis for \fIread-palmpix\fR
and exit without connecting.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-usage\fR 
.RS 
Display a brief usage message and exit without connecting.
.RE
.SH USAGE
If a filelist is not given, connects to the target Palm handheld,
and
reads the images found in the Kodak PalmPix image database
(\fBArchImage.pdb\fR), and allows the user to view the
list
of images and image details, or to select one or all of them, and
convert
them to Portable Network Graphic (.png) or Portable Pixmap (.ppm)
files to
be viewed or printed at the desktop.
.PP
If no options are specified, all of the images on the device will
be converted to ppm files by default.
.PP
If a filelist is given, convert all listed files previously fetched
via pilot-xfer. See \fIBUGS\fR - a single file argument
is
ignored, a list will work.
.SH AUTHOR
\fIread-palmpix \fRwas originally written by
Angus Ainslie <angusa at deltatee.com>, and updated by
John Marshall <jmarshall@acm.org> to include core
pilot-link functionality.

.SH BUGS
.SS "KNOWN BUGS"
\fIread-palmpix\fR's colour correction is nearly as
good as Kodak's own, but Kodak has deprecated the PalmPix device,
so it
is not likely that there will be any updates to their software in
the
future, so this may be as good as it gets. A simple method to
improve
the look of colours is to do a histogram equalization in your
favourite
image editor.
.PP
\fIread-palmpix\fR command DOES read from a file,
but only if you specify a LIST of files. If only one file is
given, the
command tries reading from \fB$PILOTPORT\fR.
