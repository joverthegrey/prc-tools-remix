.SH DESCRIPTION
By default, the contents of your Palm's memo database will be
written
to standard output as a standard UNIX mailbox (mbox-format) file, with
each
memo as a separate message. The subject of each message will be the
category.
.PP
If '-s' is specified, than instead of being written to standard
output,
will be saved in subdirectories of \fBdir\fR. Each
subdirectory
will be the name of a category on the Palm, and will contain the memos
in that
category. Each memo's filename will be the first line (up to the first
40
characters) of the memo. Control chcters, slashes, and equal signs
that would otherwise appear in filenames are converted after the
fashion of
MIME's quoted-printable encoding. Note that if you have two memos in
the
same category whose first lines are identical, one of them will be
overwritten.
.PP
If '-f' is specified, the specified file will be treated as a memo
database from which to read memos, rather than HotSyncing from the
Palm.
