Like other programs, STDOUT can be redirected to a specified output
file using the standard redirect commands:
.PP
.nf
Create a new file (empty it first if it already exists):
         \fBaddresses\fR [\-\-p \fB<port>\fR] \fB> MyAddresses.txt\fR
         (Note the redirect)    ^
      
.fi
.PP
.nf
Append to an existing file (create it if it does not exist):
         \fBaddresses\fR [\-\-p \fB<port>\fR] \fB>> MyAddresses.txt\fR
         (Note the redirect)    ^^
      
.fi
.PP
.nf

         \fBaddresses\fR [\-\-p \fB<port>\fR]\fB > MyAddresses.txt\fR
      
.fi
.PP
This will dump the Address Book from your Palm into the file
MyAddresses.txt in the format that looks similar to the following
format:
.PP
.nf

         Category: Personal Businesses
         Last name: Doe
         First name: Jane
         Company: Acme, Inc.
         Work: +1 (800) GO\-ACME
         Home: jdoe@acme.org

.fi
.PP
The output of \fBaddresses\fR can be piped to any other
command to limit the output. To only list LastName, FirstName and
Company of
all listed at the company "Acme, Inc.":
.PP
.nf

         \fBaddresses\fR [\-\-p \fB<port>\fR]\fB | grep \-B 3 "Acme, Inc."\fR
      
.fi
.PP
The accuracy of this filter depends on how consistently you have
entered the company name - missing or added punctuation will require
some
extra options in the grep command.
