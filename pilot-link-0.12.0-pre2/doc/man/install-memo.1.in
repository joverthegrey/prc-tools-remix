.SH BUGS
.SS "KNOWN BUGS"
The Palm Device has a maximum length of 4,096 bytes (4k) on
memopad
entries, if you wish to retain the ability to edit the Memo
(add/remove/change data within the memo) on the Palm itself. You
can create a memo entry of 65,490 bytes in size (the absolute
maximum) if
you do not need to edit the memo entry any further on the Palm
device
itself. Any memo larger than 4,096 bytes and less than 65,490 bytes
will
not be editable on the Palm itself. Consider these memo entries
"read-only".
.PP
This is not specifically a "bug", but a limitation in the PalmOS
design itself.
