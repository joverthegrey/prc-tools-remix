--with-os.

aliases are excluded for brevity. Please see \fIOPTIONS\fR for
the full list of available options).
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the swiss-army-knife of the entire pilot-link suite.
.PP
\fIpilot-xfer\fR allows the user to install databases
contained in the standard .prc (Palm Resource Database),
\&.pdb (Palm Record Database), and .pqa (Palm Query Application) formats
onto a Palm, retrieve databases from the Palm, list the databases
contained
in a Palm, and backup or restore all of the databases at once, and
many other powerful operations.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "PILOT-XFER OPTIONS"
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-archive\fR
<\fBdir\fR>
.RS 
Archives files which have been removed from the Palm to
<\fBdir\fR> instead of just deleting
(unlinking) them.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-backup\fR
<\fBdir\fR>
.RS 
Backs up the Palm into the specified directory (which will be
created if it does not already exist).
.RE
.PP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-cardinfo\fR
.RS 
Show information on available cards
.RE
.PP
--delete <\fBdbname\fR>
.RS 
Permanently delete the specified database(s) by name (without
extension). Obviously, be very careful with this one.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-vfsdir\fR=\fBdir\fR
.RS 
Modifies \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-i\fR or
\fB\-f\fR to use VFS \fBdir\fR
instead of internal storage
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e\fR, --exclude=\fBfile\fR
.RS 
Reads a list of databases from <\fBfile\fR>
and
prevents \fB\-\-backup\fR, \fB\-\-sync\fR, or
\fB\-\-update\fR from operating on the listed
database(s).
A maximum of 100 databases can be excluded. Databases should be
specified
by name without the extension, as displayed with --list, in any
order.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR, --fetch
<\fBdbname\fR>
.RS 
Fetch each specified database out of the Palm into the
current directory.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-Flash\fR
.RS 
Obsolete. Replaced by \fB\-\-rom\fR in v0.12.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR, --install <\fBfile\fR>
[...]
.RS 
Install each specified file into the Palm. Wildcards are
valid with
this syntax and multiple files may be listed at once.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
.RS 
Note: changed behaviour in 0.12
.PP
List all the databases in the Palm, including OS-specific
native
databases.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-Listall\fR
.RS 
Unsupported in 0.12 - see \fB\-l\fR
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-merge\fR
<\fBfile\fR> [...]
.RS 
Adds the records in each specified file into the
corresponding Palm
database.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-O\fR, --\fBOsflash\fR
.RS 
Obsolete. Replaced by \fB\-\-with\-os\fR in 0.12
.RE
.PP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-Purge\fR
.RS 
Purge any deleted data that hasn't been cleaned up by a sync
(this
is a safe operation, and will prevent your Palm from
accumulating crud
if you delete records but aren't syncing with a PIM.) The only
information you can lose is archived but un-synced records.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-restore\fR
<\fBdir\fR>
.RS 
Installs all files contained in a directory into the Palm.
(Use this
to restore your Palm after a hard reset has cleared its memory,
using your
backup directory as a baseline.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-rom\fR
.RS 
Modifies \fB\-b\fR, \fB\-u\fR, and \fB
\-s
\fR,
to back up non-OS dbs from Flash ROM
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sync\fR
<\fBdir\fR>
.RS 
Backs up the Palm into the specified directory (which will be
created if it does not already exist). Any Palm databases which
have not
been modified or created since the versions stored in the
specified
directory will not be backed up.
.PP
\fINOTE\fR: Any Palm databases which have been
deleted will have their corresponding backup file removed.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-novsf\fR
.RS 
Not supported in 0.12. No replacement.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-with\-os\fR
.RS 
Modifies \fB\-b\fR, \fB\-u\fR, and \fB
\-s
\fR,
to back up OS dbs from Flash ROM.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-update\fR
.RS 
Backs up the Palm into the specified directory (which will be
created if it does not already exist). Any Palm databases which
have
not been modified or created since the versions stored in the
specified directory will not be backed up.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-Illegal\fR
.RS 
This will back up the UnsavedPreferences.pdb file from the
Palm.
Normally this file is not backed up by normal means (Palm
Computing
recommends that you do \fInot\fR restore this
file upon
restoration of your device using \fB\-\-restore\fR.
.PP
This also modifies the behavior of \fB\-\-backup\fR,
\fB\-\-sync\fR, and \fB\-\-update\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-exec=command\fR
.RS

the connection to the pilot is made.
.RE
.SS "CONDUIT OPTIONS"
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR
<\fBport\fR>
.RS 
Use device file <\fBport\fR> to communicate
with the Palm handheld. If this is not specified,
\fIpilot-xfer\fR will look for the
\fB$PILOTPORT\fR environment variable. If neither
are
found, \fIpilot-xfer\fR will
print the usage information.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 
Display version of \fIinstall-xfer\fR
and exit without connecting.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 
Suppress 'Hit HotSync button' message
.RE
.SS "HELP OPTIONS"
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 
Display the help synopsis for \fIinstall-xfer\fR
and exit without connecting.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-usage\fR 
.RS 
Display a brief usage message and exit without connecting.
.RE
.SH USAGE
The program will connect to a target Palm handheld and port, prompt
the user to hit \fIHotSync\fR, and perform the
requested options specified by the user on the commandline.
.SH EXAMPLES
To perform a full backup of your Palm handheld: 
.PP
# using long options
.PP
\fIpilot-xfer\fR
\fB\-\-port\fR
\fB/dev/pilot\fR
\fB\-\-backup\fR
\fB$HOME/pilot/Backup\fR
.PP
# or over IrDA, using short options
.PP
\fIpilot-xfer\fR
\fB\-p\fR
\fB/dev/ircomm0\fR
\fB\-b\fR
\fB$HOME/pilot/Backup\fR
.PP
To restore that backup to a non-standard serial port (for example,
to
a xcopilot or POSE session, assuming you have xcopilot or POSE
configured properly for this operation, see the appropriate man pages
for details on configuring your emulator):
.PP
\fIpilot-xfer\fR
\fB\-p\fR
\fB/dev/ttyqe\fR
\fB\-\-restore\fR
\fB$HOME/pilot/Backup\fR
.PP
To fetch a file that is on your Palm handheld, such as the Palm
Address Book database:
.PP
\fIpilot-xfer\fR
\fB\-p\fR
\fB/dev/pilot\fR
\fB\-\-fetch\fR
\fBAddressDB\fR

.SH BUGS
.SS "KNOWN BUGS"
\fB\-\-backup\fR will currently truncate/corrupt pdb/prc
files if communication is interrupted during sync. Ideally, this
should
restore the original file, or delete the corrupted version and
restore
the original version back into place.
