.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIpi-getram\fR is used to fetch the current RAM image
from your Palm handheld for use in debugging.
.PP
\fIpi-getromtoken\fR, \fIpi-getrom\fR
and \fIpi-getram\fR are inter-related. All relevant
code is implemented in \fIpi-getrom\fR, and you can do
\fIpi-getromtoken\fR\fB\-\-ram\fR\fB
filename
\fRto get the RAM dump if you like.
.PP
Note, because \fIpi-getrom\fR uses the low-level RPC
protocol to fetch the ROM image, and the new OS5 devices do not use
this
protocol, you currently cannot fetch an OS5 ROM image using this
utility.
This will be updated in a future release to handle fetching OS5 ROM
images,
using the debugger protocol.
