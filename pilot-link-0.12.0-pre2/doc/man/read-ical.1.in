.SH DESCRIPTION
Note, this is not the same as the iCal calendar format.
.PP
\fIread-ical\fR allows the user to retrieve the
contents of the ToDo and Datebook databases on a Palm handheld, and
convert
their contents to an Ical calendar.
.PP
Note that the calendar file named by \fBfilename\fR
will be deleted, so do not use your main calendar. Instead, use a
separate
one for this purpose, and include it in your main calendar.
.PP
As \fIread-ical\fR works by passing a script to ical,
the ical application must be in your $PATH.
