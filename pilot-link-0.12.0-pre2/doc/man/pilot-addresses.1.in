.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIpilot-addresses\fR allows the user to read all
entries from a Palm handheld such as those made by
\fIPalm\fR, \fIHandspring\fR,
\fIHandera\fR, \fITRGPro\fR,
\fISony\fR or other Palm handheld in the Palm Address
Book
application, write new entries into the database, and delete a
category or
delete all entries in the database.
.SH COMMANDS
Provide exactly one of --read or --write.
.PP
\fB\-r\fR,
\fB\-\-read\fR=<\fBfile\fR>
.RS 
Reads records from <\fBfile\fR> and install
them to the Palm Address Book application. (Use the
\fB\-w\fR <\fBfile\fR> option to
get a sample "template file" for input records to see how
the fields are laid out).
.RE
.PP
\fB\-w\fR, --write=\fBfile\fR
.RS 
Reads all address book records from the Palm Address Book
application and writes them into \fBfile\fR
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "PILOT-ADDRESSES OPTIONS"
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-augment\fR
.RS 
Augments fields in address book records with additional
information.
The augmented information is placed before and separated from
the field
with a semi-colon, (;).
.PP
Augmented information can include any of the following below.
.PP
\fBcategory\fR # Placed in front of each
record or..
.PP
Placed in front of each phone number field:
.PP
["Work"|"Home"|"Fax"|"Other"|"E-mail"|"Main"|"Pager"|"Mobile"] 
.PP
Empty fields are not augmented.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR,
\fB\-\-category\fR=\fBcategory\fR
.RS 
Install records to category \fBcategory\fR by
default. Normally \fIpilot-addresses\fR uses the
\fBUnfiled\fR category by default. This option is
overridden by the category specified in the record with the
\fB\-a\fR option.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delete\-category\fR
.RS 
Delete all records in the specified category
\fBcategory\fR before installing new records.

Note that the long name of this option has changed since
0.11.8
.RE
.PP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-delete\-all\fR
.RS 
Delete all address book records in all categories. Obviously,
be
\fIvery\fR careful with this one.
.PP
Note that the long name of this option has changed since
0.11.8
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR,
\fB\-\-delimiter\fR \fBINT\fR
.RS 
Include category in each record, use the delimiter specified
to
separate all fields of a record. Delimiters are specified as
follows:
3=tab, 2=;, 1=,. This overrides the default delimiter of comma
between
fields and semi-colon between a field's augmented information.
(Please note that this may generate confusing results when used
with
the \fB\-a\fR option.)
.PP
Note that the long name of this option has changed since
0.11.8
.RE
.PP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-titles\fR

.RE
.SS "CONDUIT OPTIONS"
\fB\-p\fR,
\fB\-\-port\fR <\fBport\fR>
.RS 
Use device file <\fBport\fR> to communicate
with the Palm handheld. If this is not specified,
\fIpilot-addresses\fR will look for the
\fB$PILOTPORT\fR environment variable. If neither
are
found or supplied, \fIpilot-addresses\fR will
print the usage information.
.RE
