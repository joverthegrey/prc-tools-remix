prc-tools remix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have done my best to make this a 1click compile and install.

If you are on Mac OS you need brew installed.
The prerequisites are "texinfo flex bison gperf" and "sudo".
Then just run the install script for your platform.
When asked you must give the script root to copy the compiler to /usr/local/bin.
You must leave this repository where you cloned it or at least the "palmSdk" dir or compiling will break.

Overview
^^^^^^^^

http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/[prc-tools] is a collection of tools supporting
C and C++ programming for Palm OS. It supplies a full GCC cross-compilation
toolchain for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000_series[m68k] and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture[ARM], as well as Palm OS-specific
utilities.

Over the past decade, the Palm OS platform has surely faded into oblivion. The
last release of prc-tools, version 2.3 released in 2003, no longer even compiles
under modern versions of GCC and Clang. As a long-time Palm OS user and
occasional app developer, I decided to do something about it.

This repository is an archive of prc-tools 2.3 (and its GCC cross-compilation
toolchain), with many patches enabling it to build and run on modern Linux and
Mac OS X systems.

Building
^^^^^^^^

Linux
+++++

To build from source on Linux, e.g., on Ubuntu:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install \
    texinfo \
    flex \
    bison \
    gperf

git clone git@github.com:jichu4n/prc-tools-remix.git
cd prc-tools-remix

mkdir build && cd build
../prc-tools-2.3/configure \
    --enable-targets=m68k-palmos,arm-palmos \
    --enable-languages=c,c++ \
    --disable-nls \
    --with-palmdev-prefix=/opt/palmdev \
    --host=i686-linux-gnu
make
sudo make install
----

Mac OS X
++++++++

On Mac OS X, you can install using http://brew.sh[Homebrew] with:

[source,bash]
----
brew tap jichu4n/palm-os
brew install prc-tools
----

See the relevant https://github.com/jichu4n/homebrew-palm-os[README] for details.

To build from source on Mac OS X, assuming you have a sane build environment
from http://brew.sh[Homebrew] / Xcode:

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:jichu4n/prc-tools-remix.git
cd prc-tools-remix

mkdir build && cd build
../prc-tools-2.3/configure \
    --enable-targets=m68k-palmos,arm-palmos \
    --enable-languages=c,c++ \
    --disable-nls \
    --with-palmdev-prefix=/usr/local/opt/palmdev \
    --host=i686-apple-darwin
make
make install
----
