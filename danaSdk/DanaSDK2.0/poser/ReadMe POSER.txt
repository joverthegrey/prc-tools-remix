Dana Poser ReadMe

The latest version of the Dana poser should be used with Dana 1.2 Roms.

Most developers use the Double Scale checkbox in the Skins dialog, but you must have a very large display to just get the screen to display on your computer.  It is recommended that you run the Hemingway poser in standard mode and not the Double Scale mode.
	
The following Skin buttons can be clicked on:

Power key
F1 through F8 keys
date key
address key
todo key
memo key
find key
menu key
apps key
send key
del key
esc key

The following Skin buttons are "sticky", in that when you click them they stay "pressed" until you click them again or you click on the "clear modifiers" button:  

ctrl key
function key
cmd key
right shift key
left shift key

The caps lock key is a Skin button that is "sticky", but it is not affected by the "clear modifiers" button.

The Shift keys on the PC keyboard can be used in poser, but the form Graffiti shift indicator does not respond immediately to that input, but the incoming keys do get shifted correctly.

To get the secondary function (printed in blue) on some keys, can be activated by clicking on the function key button and then clicking on the appropriate key button.  An example would be that you can invoke the contrast dialog by clicking on the function key button and then clicking on the contrast key button.  Remember to click on the function key button to turn it off or else everything you type or click on will have the function modifier bit attached to it.

The Slow Keys and Sticky Keys feature in the Keyboard application does not work on poser.  The Auto Repeat functionality does not work on poser.  The keys will repeat in poser, but the Auto Repeat is being generated by the PC or Mac and not poser.

The Mac poser will freeze when keys are type very quickly.  This is a known issue with the PalmSource poser, also.
